# Objective Problem
Below, we provide a sample **objective problem** from Course X along with its corresponding grading rubrics (i.e., solution quality and writing quality rubrics).

## Problem Statement
You’re trying to collect all $n$ distinct cards from your favorite trading card game. The only way to
obtain new cards is to purchase a sealed pack of one uniformly random card. After you buy a pack,
you open it, see the card inside, and add it to your collection. If you have at least one copy of each
of the $n$ cards, you stop. Otherwise, you purchase a new pack. Prove that the expected number of
packs you purchase is $\Theta(n \log n)$ .

## Solution Quality Rubric
| **Rubric Item ID** | **Rubric Item Description** | **Rubric Item Points** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 5 | The solution is fully correct. In particular, there is a concrete outline (perhaps implicit, not necessarily explicitly stated) that is correct, and each step of the outline is implemented correctly with an appropriate level of detail. In particular, the logical flow of the solution is fully correct and explained clearly. It is not necessary to verify all the calculations, as long as it is *clear* that the logic is sound, and the answer is correct. | 8.0 |
| 4 | The solution clearly has all of the main ideas, but there are some minor (but non-trivial) issues with the logical flow. Please identify what is missing. For example, perhaps the answer is correct, but the logical flow in justification is flawed. | 6.5 |
| 3 | The solution makes significant, concrete, partial progress, but does not fully solve the problem. Please give brief feedback to help generalize what is provided into further progress. | 5.0 |
| 2 | The solution makes some concrete partial progress, but it is not very far towards a complete solution. Please give brief feedback to help generalize what is provided into further progress. | 3.0 |
| 1 | The solution does not make any concrete partial progress, but demonstrates a good understanding of the problem being asked. | 1.0 |
| 0 | The solution is absent or flawed. | 0.0 |

## Writing Quality Rubric
| **Rubric Item ID** | **Rubric Item Description** | **Rubric Item Points** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 4 | The solution is written clearly. It is easy to understand the solution’s logical flow, and it is easy to see that each step of the outline is implemented with appropriate detail. It is OK if the outline is not explicitly stated (provided that one can find the outline while reading the solution). If there are grammatical mistakes, typos, or calculation errors, this is OK if they do not interfere with ability to process the logical flow. If the mistakes are severe enough that it becomes hard to process the logical flow, a lower mark should be used. | 2.0 |
| 3 | The solution is written pretty clearly. It is generally easy to understand the solution’s concrete outline, and it is not too bad to see that each step of the outline is implemented with appropriate detail. But, there may have been parts of the logical flow that were tricky to follow. | 1.5 |
| 2 | The solution is written OK, but required some struggle to understand the logical flow. Perhaps a large part of the solution was challenging to understand, although there are also parts that are clear. | 1.0 |
| 1 | Some parts of the solution were clear and easy to follow, but much of the solution requires some struggle to understand the logical flow. | 0.5 |
| 0 | The solution was tough to evaluate. The solution may have made imprecise claims, and it was not easy to figure out what was intended. The solution may have made false claims, and it was not easy to see why they were false. It may have been a struggle to figure out the intended logical flow, or to figure out exactly what concrete claims the solution accomplished. | 0.0 |
