# Examples 
Problems in Course X featured two key types of proof questions: **objective problems** and **subjective problems**.

**Objective problems** require students to directly apply proof techniques and principles taught in class. These problems are graded using a rubric with a single category, **solution correctness (SC)**, which consists of multiple disjoint rubric items. 

**Subjective problems** require students to construct proofs from scratch, allowing for a variety of valid approaches. These are graded using two rubric categories: **solution quality (SQ)** and **writing quality**.

We provide an example of an objective problem along with its corresponding grading rubrics from Course X as well as a subjective problem along with its corresponding grading rubrics in [`objective_problem.md`](/examples/objective_problem.md) and [`subjective_problem.md`](/examples/objective_problem.md) respectively.
