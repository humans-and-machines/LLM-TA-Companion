# Objective Problem
Below, we provide a sample **objective problem** from Course X along with its corresponding grading rubric (i.e., solution correctness rubric).

## Problem Statement
Compute the expectation of the discrete random variable $X$, where $X = i$ with probability $2^{-i}$, for all integers $i \geq 1$.

## Solution Correctness Rubric
| **Rubric Item ID** | **Rubric Item Description** | **Rubric Item Points** |
|---------------------|-----------------------------|-------------------------|
| 5 | The solution is correct. Recall that no justification is required if the answer is correct. | 10.0 |
| 4 | The solution is incorrect, but there is enough justification to find an exceptionally simple fix. If the mistake is just *obviously* a typo, it is OK to give full credit. | 9.0 |
| 3 | The solution is incorrect, but there is enough justification to find a pretty simple fix. | 8.0 |
| 2 | The solution is incorrect, and there is enough justification to understand what happened, but it is not a simple fix. | 5.0 |
| 1 | An answer is given, but there is not enough justification to understand what happened. | 2.9 |
| 0 | The solution is absent or flawed. | 1.0 |
